        Amalia.js is a new extensible and versatile HTML5 multimedia player that allows you to view any type of metadata along with your video or audio streams. It follows the responsive design
        guidelines. Although initially developed as a tool to visualize the metadata extracted automatically by our algorithms (<a href="http://recherche.ina.fr/eng/">you can see some prototypes
            online</a>), we believe it can be useful more broadly. Thus, we choose to share it as an open-source project under a GPL license. If you find amalia.js usefull, plan to use it, or even modify
        it, don't hesitate to contact us.
    </p>
    <p>Amalia.js is composed of three main parts :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the core player</li>
        <li>the unified metadata format</li>
        <li>the visualization plugins</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Amalia.js is developed and maintained by the Research Department and the IT Department of <a href="http://www.institut-national-audiovisuel.fr/en/home" target="_blank">Ina (the French
            National Audiovisual Institute)</a>.
